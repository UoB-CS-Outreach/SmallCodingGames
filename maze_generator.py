"""Generate and validate text mazes for the browser maze game.

Difficulty is a question of maze structure, not only size. Each level adds one
new idea that the previous strategy cannot handle:

===========  ==========  ==================================================
Difficulty   Style       New concept
===========  ==========  ==================================================
easy         corridor    One winding route: turns, but no branches and no
                         dead ends.
medium       perfect     Junctions and dead ends, still with exactly one
                         route between any two squares.
hard         braided     A few loops and wall islands, so a purely local
                         rule can repeat the same route forever.
expert       braided     Many loops, islands and open rooms.
             + rooms
plaza        plaza       An open hall of free-standing pillars: no wall
                         worth following at all.
marathon     braided     Expert's structure at twice the area, with routes
             + rooms     long enough that an inefficient one runs out of
                         steps before it arrives.
===========  ==========  ==================================================

The right-hand rule is guaranteed on ``corridor`` and ``perfect`` mazes
because their passages contain no loops and their walls form a single
connected shape. It is deliberately *not* guaranteed from ``hard`` onwards.

``blocks`` remains available as an unstructured random-block test case built
around a protected start-to-goal route.

The module has no browser or third-party dependencies, so it can also be used
from tests or other tooling::

    maze = generate_difficulty("hard", seed=42)
